              <p>I am grateful for my family. My wife and I met in college and have two sons and one daughter. We live in Texas close to both of our families. We stay pretty active going to hockey, baseball, basketball, and football games. I often take my oldest son camping, youngest son to the park, and my daughter for walks. My wife and I love live music, visiting wineries, and checking out new restaurants.</p>

          <h2 id="interest-header">The Outdoors</h2>
          <section class="interest-text">
            <p>The outdoors bring me peace and remind me of how lucky we are to be alive on this wonder planet. My oldest son and I go camping with my father-in-law often. It is a pretty cool experience teaching a young human about the world around them. My goal is to one day own land in Alaska or Canada. Other outdoor activities I enjoy are hiking, fishing, and mountain biking.</p>

              <p>Continous learning is something I am extremely passionate about. In today's world with acces to the internet, we can learn anything. We live in an amazing time with the rise of AI, advancements in medicine, and cool companies like SpaceX and BlueOrigin trying to make humans a multiplanetary species. Some of my favorite topics include mathematics, economics, business strategy, information theory, analytics, and software engineering. Currently, my focus is on software engineering and cyber security. If I can teach my kids one thing other than being a good person, it is to be a lifelong learner.</p>
